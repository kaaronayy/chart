docker is a virtual machine 
to create a container, you need a template first - we call these images
run applications/containers as daemons
docker run -dit --name selllinux ubuntu 
//creates a container of the image of ubuntu

do stuff in the container by entering the container with
docker exec -it __container id or name___

docker exec -it __container id__ bash
//enters into shell to configure inside the container

to check if it is running you check the browser at the IP address that is shown to you when you start the docker machine (docker-machine start)

containers can run on port xy but they need to be exposed to a port locally to be visible i.e. 

docker exec -dit -p 8080:xy 


need a file called app.py that imports teh python file and has an instantiator to render the python file






Everything needs a route
needs a Dockerfile
needs an app.py
need to expose the port
